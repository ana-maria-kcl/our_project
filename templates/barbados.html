    <p><it>While it's justifiably famed for its fantastic beaches, Barbados is an island that has it all. In addition to fine powdery sand and brilliant turquoise bays, you'll find smashing nightlife, a Unesco World Heritage–listed capital, a beautiful interior dotted with gardens, and wild surf on the lonely east coast, all inhabited by a proud and welcoming populace.</it><br>
    <b>What to see</b><br>
    <p><it>St Nicholas Abbey is one of the oldest plantation houses in the Caribbean. The grounds are simply gorgeous and the rum and sugar museum houses historical artefacts, including slave records and ledgers.
    The George Washington House was the home of the US president and his brother Lawrence during their stay in 1751. It now houses a museum bringing 18th-century Barbados to life.
    The heart of Oistins is its large, bustling seaside fish market. On Friday and Saturday it hosts the island's best party, with soca, reggae, pop and country music, vendors selling barbecued fish and plenty of rum drinking. It's roughly 80 per cent locals, 20 per cent tourists, and rocks till 2am.
    Few people follow the coast south of Bathsheba. They should. Look for signs for Martin's Bay, where you'll find a sliver of beach and a little rum shop. After about two more miles, a steep road leads down to Bath Beach, empty on weekdays and crowded with families on weekends.</it><br>
    <b>Where to eat and drink</b><br>
    On the Speightstown waterfront, the Fisherman's Pub is a local institution that serves up fish from the boats floating off the back deck, with steel-pan music on Wednesdays. Try the national dish of cou-cou (cornmeal and okra) and flying fish.
    David's Place is a very romantic spot overlooking St Lawrence Bay. Waiters glide about with seafood platters and Creole curries.
    The popular Roundhouse Restaurant overlooks the world-famous reef break known as Soup Bowl. There's banana bread at breakfast, sandwiches and salads at lunch, and specials such as breadfruit soup at dinner.
    Ragamuffins , in bustling Holetown, specialises in Caribbean dishes with attitude: the blackened fish with aioli is pure joy. On Sunday there's a drag show.
    The much-loved Brown Sugar is a tropical paradise. The West Indian buffet is popular and the Bajan bread pudding is a rummy delight.<br>
